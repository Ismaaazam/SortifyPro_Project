# SortifyPro_Project

SortifyPro is a GUI-based C# application designed to analyze and compare the performance of various **parallel sorting algorithms**.  
It provides insights into **execution time, speedup, and efficiency**, helping understand how modern systems handle large-scale data sorting.

---

## Features
- Intuitive **GUI** for comparing multiple parallel sorting algorithms
- Supports **parallel merge sort**, **parallel quicksort**, and **parallel radix sort**
- Customizable **input parameters** (e.g., array size)
- Real-time display of **execution time, speedup, and efficiency**
- Visual **graphs** for analyzing algorithm performance

---

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** C#
- **Framework:** .NET
- **Parallelism:** Task-based parallel processing
- **Interface:** Windows Forms (WinForms)

---

## How It Works
1. Select sorting algorithms and set input parameters.
2. Run experiments to measure **execution time, efficiency, and speedup**.
3. Compare results through intuitive **graphs and detailed metrics**.

---

## Why This Project?
SortifyPro was built to explore **parallel computing** and demonstrate how efficient algorithms can significantly improve the performance of large-scale data operations.
