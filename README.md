# SortifyPro_Project

SortifyPro is a GUI-based C# application designed to analyze and compare the performance of various **parallel sorting algorithms**.  
It provides insights into **execution time, speedup, and efficiency**, helping understand how modern systems handle large-scale data sorting.

---

## Features
- Intuitive **GUI** for comparing multiple parallel sorting algorithms
- Supports **parallel merge sort**, **parallel quicksort**, and **parallel radix sort**
- Customizable **input parameters** (e.g., array size)
- Real-time display of **execution time, speedup, and efficiency**
- Visual **graphs** for analyzing algorithm performance
